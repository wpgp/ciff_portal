        <h3>Exceedance probability and confidence in changes over time</h3>
        <hr/>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            We have produced 5x5km high-resolution (also referred to as grid level) prediction and uncertainty maps illustrating changes over time for health and development indicators within specific subnational areas, such as districts or similar administrative divisions varying by country. Our methodology relies on data from the two most recent rounds of the nationally representative Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), which are available at the cluster level, and mapped through GPS coordinates of the cluster centres. In the case of India, we utilised the National Family Health Surveys (NFHS), specifically NFHS-4 (2015-16) denoted as Round 1, and NFHS-5 (2019-22) denoted as Round 2. Measuring changes between these survey rounds allows us to track and assess the progress of the health and development indicators over time
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure the reliability of our estimates of the changes within each subnational area, we employed exceedance probability to quantify our confidence in these observed changes. Exceedance probability, commonly applied in environmental and risk analysis Richards et al., 2014, assesses the likelihood of an event surpassing a specific limit within a defined period (Soch, 2020). In simpler terms, exceedance probability helps us assess potential improvements or worsening of our health and development indicators. We express this likelihood as a percentage, indicating the probability of an indicator exceeding our defined threshold. For this work, we use the statistical significance levels of 90% (likely), 95% (highly likely), and 99% (almost certain). 
        </p>

        <h4>Outline</h4>
        <p>
            We outline the entire process of implementing and applying exceedance probability using the indicator "Percentage of women who had 4 or more antenatal visits" (ANC4+) in India as an example. For India, the subnational areas are the districts. This outline unfolds in three main steps: (1) preparation, (2) implementation, and (3) application. Further detail can be found in the Methods section.

        <h5>Preparation</h5>
        <div className='row p-0 m-0 px-3'>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Sample grid-level estimates from the posterior distributions of the models. These models, processed through the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation â€“ Stochastic Partial Differential Equation method (INLA-SPDE) (Rue et al., 2009; Lindgren et al., 2011; Martins et al., 2013), pertain to the two rounds of survey data for ANC4+. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Derive grid-level change estimate samples by calculating the difference between the grid-level estimate samples of Round 2 and Round 1. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Aggregate the grid level change estimate samples to the subnational level, specifically at the district level, to obtain district level change estimate samples (see Figure 1a). 
            </li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <h5>Implementation</h5>
        <div className='row p-0 m-0 px-3'>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The district level change estimate samples can be depicted using an empirical cumulative density function (ECDF) (Dekking et al., 2005). The ECDF offers insights into the probability, given the data, that the true change is equal to or less than a specified value. It derives from the proportion of samples that are equal to or less than the specified value. For change in ANC4+, we are interested in the district estimate value zero, because we want to observe where there have been meaningful improvements for ANC4+.  
            </li>
            <li>
                The ECDF at zero for each district indicates the proportion of samples equal to or less than zero. This informs us of the probability, given the data, that the true change is less than or equal to zero. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The complement of the ECDF at zero, calculated as 1 - ECDF(0), tells us the proportion of samples greater than zero. This provides the probability, given the data, that the true change is greater than zero (see Figure 1b). 
            </li>
        </ol>
        </div>

        <h5>Application</h5>
        <div className='row p-0 m-0 px-3'>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To ensure a high level of certainty (95% certain) that district level estimates are greater than zero, compare the probability (or proportion) obtained with 95% (or 0.95). Adjust the slider in the Portal to highlight districts where improvements are highly certain (95% certain). 
            </li>
            <li>
                Conversely, if the probability (or proportion) is below 95% (less than 0.95), it indicates a lack of high certainty (95% certain) regarding meaningful improvements in those districts. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Steps 1 and 2 can be repeated for various certainty levels (see Figure 1c).

        <h4>Methods</h4>
        <p>
            In examining changes in ANC4, we employed the statistical method INLA-SPDE to estimate ANC4+ values. This method generates "best estimations" (posterior distributions) based on available data, enabling us to predict potential ANC4 values. By comparing these values across different survey rounds, we obtain samples representing changes at grid and district levels.
        </p>
        <p>
            To ensure reliability in these estimates, we utilised the ECDF. The ECDF visually represents the likelihood of observing specific changes in ANC4+. For example, the ECDF at zero indicates the likelihood of observing changes equal to or less than zero in ANC4+. Its complement, calculated as 1 minus the ECDF value at zero, informs us about the probability, given the data, of observing changes greater than zero (see Figure 1c). We then apply this information by comparing probabilities from the ECDF at zero against a 95% threshold, illustrated in Figure 1d, to highlight districts where improvements are highly certain (95% certain).  
        </p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>
            Our utilisation of exceedance probability establishes a robust framework for interpreting changes over time, offering critical insights into trends and the potential for achieving significant improvements within specified timeframes. For example, assessing the exceedance probability associated with the prevalence of stunting provides valuable insights into the reduction of stunting over time. This methodology empowers policymakers by providing a credible assessment of trends, enabling informed decisions for effective interventions.

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            The India NFHS surveys are constructed to be representative at national, province and district level for most of the indicators. In the case of rare events indicators such as stillbirth rates, or where more sophisticated estimation methods were needed such as mortality rates (child and neonatal mortality rates), indicators were constructed and mapped at district level using the surveys. Specifically, for four indicators named, unsafe abortion, neonatal mortality rate, child mortality rate and stillbirth rate we used a two-step approach: <b>Step 1</b>. We followed the methods described in Subramaniam et al. (2021) and Ulahannan et al. (2022) to match the 2015-16 NFHS-4 data to 2019-21 NFHS-5 boundaries (ICF. The Demographic and Health Surveys Program Spatial Data Repository), in order to be able to compare changing districts over time; <b>Step 2</b>. Once all data were available at NFHS-5 boundaries, we rasterised the data for the whole country and then aggregated the data using the district level official boundaries of India (Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India), which were used for final display on the online portal. Average values for districts were used for aggregation.
        </p>
        <p>
            For child worker, census estimates were used to calculate the indicator, and only had one point in time was available. Since census boundaries aligned with NFHS-4 boundaries, the same two-step approached as described above was applied.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the surveys were designed to be representative at the district level, caution is advised in interpreting and utilizing the findings due to the inherent limitations posed by small sample sizes for the mentioned indicators
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, it is important to note that the indicators discussed herein are rare events, further emphasizing the need for careful consideration and caution in their interpretation, given the limited sample sizes at the district level.
        </p>

        <h5>Step 1. Harmonising boundaries from round 1 (NFHS-4) to round 2 (NFHS-5) to match round 2 (NFHS-5)</h5>
        <p>
            The administrative boundaries of India for the year 2015-2016 (NFHS-4) count a total of 640 districts while the administrative boundaries of India for the year 2019-2021 (NFHS-5) count a total of 707 districts (67 additional districts) (ICF. The Demographic and Health Surveys Program Spatial Data Repository). However, there are 36 states in both years with changes. The boundary changes begin with the addition of new states and the removal of some states, for example, at the state level, a new state Ladakh was created in 2019-2021 from Jammu and Kashmir, as shown in Figure 1 below.
        </p>

        <Figure src={disaggregation} label='dissagregation' number='1' width='600px'
            caption={'States dissagregation example'}/>
        
        <p>
            Meanwhile, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu, two distinct states have now merged to form a new state called Dadra & Nagar Haveli & Daman & Diu as shown below in Figure 2.
        </p>

        <Figure src={aggregation} label='aggregation' number='2' width='550px'
            caption={'States agregation example'}/>

        <p>
            For the additional 67 districts, data from NFHS-4 are not available therefore, to be able to compare changes in indicators aggregated at the district level, we applied a simple methodology to harmonize geographical boundaries across the two time periods and assign the corresponding indicator value following Subramaniam et al. (2021) and Ulahannan et al. (2022). The methodology that we applied involves re-assigning indicators' values calculated from NFHS-4 data to all the 2019-21 NFHS-5 districts. This approach therefore does not make any alterations to the 2019-21 NFHS-5 data that are reported at the district level.
        </p>

        <p>
            The newly created 67 districts were formed from one or more districts included in the NFHS-4 dataset and can be divided into two different categories: type 1 and type 2. Type 1 districts (55 districts) were formed by altering the boundaries of one single district from 2015-16 NFHS-4 administrative boundaries and creating one new district. In comparison, type 2 districts (12 districts) were formed by adding geographical units from two or more parent districts. For the type 1 districts formed from one single parent district we assigned the same indicator's value as the parent district (Figure 3 and Table 1)
        </p>

        <Figure src={type1} label='type1' number='3' width='400px'
            caption={'Example of type 1 districts (Assam State)'}/>

        <p>
            In the example above the type 1 districts Biswanath and Hojai were formed from the parent district Sonitpur and Nagaon, respectively. For example, to calculate the NFHS-5 Unsafe abortion values, the new district (Biswanath) takes the same value for its parent district (Sonitpur). The same is applicable to the 95% Lower and Upper Confidence Intervals (CI) as shown in the table below:

        <h5>Step 2. Rasterization and harmonisation to national official boundaries to enable over time comparisons</h5>

        <p>
            With indicator values for the 707 NFHS-5 districts in table format, these are joined to the NFHS-5 district boundary shapefile using a common attribute (State_District). For each indicator and confidence intervals within the joined table, the shapefile is rasterized, to match the raster properties (coordinate system, cell size and grid alignment) derived from a common mastergrid of the national boundaries (WorldPop et al, 2018). The rasterized indicator values are then summarized using the district level official boundaries of India (Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India) by using a GIS tool that calculates the zonal statistics using R (2021) software. This produces statistics (mean and median) from all the raster cells that sit within each district boundary so that indicator values are generated for each of the 742 districts. Medians were used to summarise the indicators of interest. This outputted table can be exported as a csv file or shapefile. A flowchart of the steps can be found in Figure 5.

            For this work, Population Division, United States Census Bureau (USCB) open access boundaries were used for geographical aggregations and for displaying purposes. USCB produced administrative level 1 and 2 boundaries in line with the subnational administrative structure used for Kenyaâ€™s 2019 census. Kenya national boundaries as reported by the USCB datasets were made to align to the Large Scale International Boundary Line (LSIB) dataset from the United States. The U.S. Census Bureauâ€™s products are open access and can be accessed from <a href='https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/demo/international-programs/subnationalpopulation.html' target='_blank'>here</a>.

            For modelled-based indicators (5x5km high resolution maps), official national country boundaries were used to model and summarise the estimates at sub-county level (US Census Bureau). Pixels coinciding with known water bodies were left as NAs and were ignored when aggregating to administrative boundaries. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For selected indicators where high resolution modelling of the DHS data was not appropriate (e.g. rare events indicators such as stillbirth rate, exclusive breastfeeding, and low birth weight), county level only estimates were used. The DHS data are representative of counties as defined by the DHS (KNBS and ICF, 2023). This required processing to join the tabular data to the DHS county-level boundaries used in the original data collection for both round 1 (Kenya DHS-7, 2014) and 2 (Kenya DHS-8, 2022, DHS Spatial Data Repository), before rasterizing in line with a Kenya mastergrid and re-summarising using the USCB county-level boundaries, taking the mean pixel value falling within a given boundary. KPHC data (Child Labour) was joined to the USCB county-level boundaries based on name. Changes in the areas between DHS-7 and DHS-8 in selected counties were inspected and considered negligible for this work. All GIS processing was carried out in ArcGIS Pro 2.7.3.

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                In this work, 5x5 km cell-level estimates for two separate time pointsâ€”2014 and 2018 for the two NTDs, and 2014 and 2017 for the two mortality indicatorsâ€”were sourced and downloaded from <a href='https://ghdx.healthdata.org/' target='_blank'>the IHME websites</a>. The data were further aggregated to sub-counties (second-level administrative units) of Kenya using the Population Division. US Census Bureau national and subnational boundaries.
            </p>

            <h4>Data</h4>
            <h5>Prevalence (%) of onchocerciasis infection in the population</h5>
            <p>
                The source data used to populate this indicator describe onchocerciasis prevalence across Africa and Yemen from 2000 to 2018, and were produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME, 2022; Schmidt et al. 2022). To produce these data a systematic review of published literature on onchocerciasis-related infection and prevalence from 1975-2017 was first undertaken by IHME. Prevalence data linked to 14,043 unique locations across the Americas, Africa and Yemen were extracted from 259 peer-reviewed articles identified by the review. These data were modelled alongside several ecological, environmental and epidemiological covariates in a Bayesian geostatistical framework to estimate the annual prevalence of onchocerciasis from 2000 to 2018 in 5km2 spatial resolution grid cells. Mean, 2.5% quantile (lower) and 97.5% quantile (upper) cell-level estimates were extracted from the predictive posterior distribution, and represent the estimated percentage of the (all ages and both sexes) population at that location who are prevalent with onchocerciasis at the relevant timepoint. Prevalent cases are those with presence of microfiladermia, detected by skin snip microscopy. Estimates were not generated for any cells whose: (i) land cover was classified as "barren or sparsely vegetated" by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data for 2015; or (ii) total population density was less than ten persons per 1km2 grid cell according to WorldPop population estimates for 2015. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The data shown represent the prevalence (%) of onchocerciasis infection in the population, indicated by the presence of microfiladermia as detected by skin snip microscopy (%) 
            </p>

            <h5>Prevalence (%) of lymphatic filariasis infection in the population</h5>
            <p>
                The source data used to populate this indicator describe global lymphatic filariasis prevalence from 2000 to 2018 and were produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME, 2020; Local burden of Disease NTD collaborators, 2020). To produce these data a systematic review of published literature on lymphatic filariasis-related infection and prevalence from 1990 onwards was first undertaken by IHME. This was further supplemented by additional programme monitoring data obtained from: (i) the WHO's Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis; and (ii) the WHO's Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Neglected Tropical Diseases. Prevalence data linked to 15,829 unique global locations were extracted from 301 peer-reviewed articles identified by the review. These data were modelled alongside several covariates representing ecological, demographic, and programmatic factors related to lymphatic filariasis in a Bayesian geostatistical framework to estimate the annual prevalence from 2000 to 2018 in 5km2 spatial resolution grid cells. Mean, 2.5% quantile (lower) and 97.5% quantile (upper) cell-level estimates were extracted from the predictive posterior distribution, and represent the estimated percentage of the (all ages and both sexes) population at that location who are prevalent at the relevant timepoint. Prevalent cases are those with lymphatic filariasis as measured by the immunochromatographic (ICT) antigen test. Estimates were not generated for any cells whose: (i) land cover was classified as "barren or sparsely vegetated" by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data for 2015; or (ii) total population density was less than ten persons per 1km2 grid cell according to WorldPop population estimates for 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data shown represent the prevalence (%) of lymphatic filariasis infection in the population, as measured by the ICT antigen test.
            </p>

            <h5>Under five mortality</h5>
            <p>
                The source data used to populate this indicator describe estimated child mortality rates across 99 low-and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2017 and were produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME, 2019; Burstein et al. 2019). To produce estimates in 5km2 spatial resolution grid cells, input data from the Global Burden of Disease study were modelled by IHME alongside several sociodemographic, environmental and epidemiological covariates in a Bayesian geostatistical framework. Mean, 2.5% quantile (lower) and 97.5% quantile (upper) cell-level mortality probabilities amongst children aged 0-28 days (neonates), under 1 year (infants), and under 5 years (under 5s) were separately estimated from the posterior probability distribution. Estimated probabilities were not generated for any cells whose: (i) land cover was classified as "barren or sparsely vegetated" by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data for 2015; or (ii) total population density was less than ten persons per 1km2 grid cell according to WorldPop population estimates for 2015. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The data shown represent the modelled probability of death amongst children aged under 5 years, multiplied by 1,000 to calculate mortality rates. The indicator is therefore expressed as a mortality rate per 1,000 live births.
            </p>

            <h5>Neonatal mortality</h5>
            <p>
                The source data used to populate this indicator describe estimated child mortality rates across 99 low-and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2017 and were produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME, 2019; Burstein et al. 2019). To produce estimates in 5km2 spatial resolution grid cells, input data from the Global Burden of Disease study were modelled by IHME alongside several sociodemographic, environmental and epidemiological covariates in a Bayesian geostatistical framework. Mean, 2.5% quantile (lower) and 97.5% quantile (upper) cell-level mortality probabilities amongst children aged 0-28 days (neonates), under 1 year (infants), and under 5 years (under 5s) were separately estimated from the posterior probability distribution. Estimated probabilities were not generated for any cells whose: (i) land cover was classified as "barren or sparsely vegetated" by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data for 2015; or (ii) total population density was less than ten persons per 1km2 grid cell according to WorldPop population estimates for 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data shown represent the modelled probability of death amongst children aged 0-28 days, multiplied by 1,000 to calculate mortality rates. The indicator is therefore expressed as a mortality rate per 1,000 live births. 
            </p>

            <h4>Processing</h4>
            <p>
                IHME data is provided at a resolution of 5km. Data was resampled and re-projected to align with a 1km mastergrid covering the full extent of Kenya. Sub-county level summaries were captured using this resampled 1km data, whilst high-resolution output maps (raster) were produced from the original 5km resolution data aligned to the mastergrid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where there were missing/NA pixels in the original raster's due to differing coastline definitions between datasets, cell values were interpolated. Otherwise, all other missing/NA pixels present in the original data were left as missing/NA.
            </p>
            <p>
                All processing was carried out in ArcGIS Pro 2.7.3 
            </p>

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                In this work, 5x5 km high spatial resolution surfaces for Soil-transmitted helminth infection (STH) and Schistosomiasis (SCHI) in Kenya were produced using Bayesian geostatistical models. These geostatistical models were constructed using WHOâ€™s Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Tropical Diseases (ESPEN) site unitsâ€™ locations for a range of years (WHO-ESPEN). All clusters surveyed between 2010 and 2015 (for soil-transmitted helminth infection) and between 2010 and 2018 (for schistosomiasis infection) were employed as input data in the model; while we used a range of environmental, climatic, geographical, and socio-economic datasets as covariates.
            </p>
            <p>
                A Bayesian geostatistical modeling approach was employed to construct 5x5 km high spatial resolution surfaces, including the prediction (mean) and uncertainty (standard deviation) surfaces. Also, using the grid-level high-resolution modelled outputs and uncertainty surfaces produced, we performed population-weighted aggregation up to the county and subcounty levels (US Census Bureau).
            </p>

            <h4>Data</h4>
            <p>
                The source data used to populate this indicator describe STH and SCHI in Kenya, and were sourced from the WHOâ€™s Expanded Special Project for Elimination of Tropical Diseases (ESPEN) database. ESPEN covers all 47 countries of the WHO AFRO region and five countries of the WHO EMRO region (Sudan, Egypt, Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen). The source STH and SCHI prevalence data had been extracted from the Global Atlas of Helminth Infections (see Pullan et al., 2011) and were available at the level of â€˜site unitsâ€™, which are the sites of cross-sectional prevalence surveys conducted in representative research or sentinel populations. Relevant surveys were identified through structured searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of local archives and libraries, and direct contact with researchers. Any data based on hospital or clinic surveys, post-intervention surveys, or surveys among sub-populations (such as refugees, prisoners or nomads) were excluded from the ESPEN database. The database collects all surveys found to meet the inclusion criteria, regardless of the year of collection/publication, many of which reported a prevalence value linked to GPS coordinates. While most surveys had included participants of all ages, some were limited to a specific age group only; surveys of the latter type usually involved a population of children and/or adolescents, but alternate age ranges were sometimes used. All available survey data were used to fit the models described below.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, a range of environmental, climatic, geographical, and socioeconomic covariates were selected and incorporated within the statistical models for predicting the health indicators.
            </p>

            <h4>Methods</h4>
            <p>
                The geospatial modelling methodology utilised in this work made use of data for the STH and SCHI from WHO ESPEN, along with environmental, climatic, geographical, and socioeconomic variables incorporated as predictors within the statistical model for predicting health and development indicators from household surveys. These covariates represent the candidate covariates on which robust covariate selection was performed.  
            </p>
            <p>
                These data were employed using the disease site units' locations as inputs in our analyses, with the indicator being STH and SCHI used as the outcome variables to be predicted, and the geospatial covariates used as predictors in the model.
            </p>
            <p>
                For STH the modelled indicator was the cumulative infection by any of the soil transmitted helminths Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and the hookworms Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. This was calculated from the individual infection rates using the method suggested in de Silva and Hall (2010).
            </p>

                A geostatistical model was fitted using the integrated nested Laplace approximation â€“ stochastic partial differential equations (INLA-SPDE) method. From this model 5x5 km high spatial resolution surfaces, including the prediction (mean) and uncertainty (standard deviation) surfaces, were constructed (Rue et al., 2009; Lindgren et al., 2011; Martins et al., 2013). The high-resolution outputs of the model were also aggregated to county and subcounty level using population weighted averaging using unadjusted population counts for Kenya.

            <h4>Notes</h4>
            <p>
                Estimates for counties for which there were fewer than 5 clusters were disregarded, while counties where surveyed points were between 5 and 30 were flagged as showing high uncertainty.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Counties which do not have environmental suitability for STH infection (defined as maximum daytime land surface temperature exceeding 40 degrees Celsius) were not modelled and are marked grey. This is based on indications described in the Pullan et al. (2011).
